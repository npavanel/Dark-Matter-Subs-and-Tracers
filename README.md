# Dark-Matter-Subs-and-Tracers

Process:  <br />
Data files are generated from simulations with the general script, and plots of dispersion in variable vs time for multiple suites can be created using the analysis function. For other plots (energy vs time, etc.) and fits, and for further detail, see the JupyterLab.

Background:  <br />
Multiple recent studies support the Standard Model of Cosmology in that orbiting dark matter subhalos exist within the galactic dark matter halos that house galaxies. 

These functions were used to determine how different attirbutes of dark matter subhalos factor into the perturbative effects that they have tracer particle orbits. The general idea is to simulate one tracer particle on a circular orbit without dark matter subhalos and another on a circular orbit with dark matter subhalos, and compare the results to produce an estimate for the amount to which dark matter subhalos pull galactic globular clusters to new orbits.

Simply put, the simulation function produces a data set that contains the the time evolution of the tracer particle's orbital radius, x-y-z postions, vx-vy-vz velocites, orbital energy, and various simulation information like total number of subhalos and subhalos per mass range. The analysis function produces the plots that were determined to be of interest.

This study produces equations that predict the energy evolution, and the radius evolution, of a particle that evolves within a population of dark matter subhalos and predicts that a smaller number of interactions with subhalos of larger mass will produce larger orbital deviations in orbits than many interactions with subhalos of smaller mass (check link at bottom for specific numbers), that orbital deviations are of negligible size in galactic environments with a substructure mass fraction that is less than 1%, that denser subhalos produce larger orbital deviations, and that globular clusters of the Milky Way likey have experianced a negligblel change in their orbits due to subhalos.
